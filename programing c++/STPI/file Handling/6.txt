The Internship Opportunity I Had With STPI Was A Great Chance For Learning And Professional Development. Therefore, I Consider Myself As A Very Lucky Individual As I Was Provided With An Opportunity To Be A Part Of It. I Am Also Grateful For Having A Chance To Meet So Many Wonderful People And Professionals Who Led Me Though This Internship Period.
Bearing In Mind Previous I Am Using This Opportunity To Express My Deepest Gratitude And Special Thanks To Ramesh Meena (Instructor) Who In Spite Of Being Extraordinarily Busy With His Duties, Took Time Out To Hear, Guide And Keep Me On The Correct Path And Allowing Me To Carry Out My Project At Their Esteemed Organization And Extending During The Training.
I Perceive As This Opportunity As A Big Milestone In My Career Development. I Will Strive To Use Gained Skills And Knowledge In The Best Possible Way, And I Will Continue To Work On Their Improvement, In Order To Attain Desired Career Objectives. Hope To Continue Cooperation With All Of You In The Future.
Thanks.
